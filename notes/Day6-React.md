# 📘 Day 6 – Using React Developer Tools Extension

As I continue building projects in React, I’ve realized that working with **multiple components** can become overwhelming, especially as the app grows in size.

To help manage this complexity, I explored the **React Developer Tools** extension — a powerful browser extension for debugging React apps.

## 🔍 What It Does

React Developer Tools allows you to:

- **Inspect the React component tree** directly in your browser's dev tools
- **View the props and state** of each component
- **Identify which component is rendering what**
- **Trace re-renders** and optimize performance

This tool is extremely helpful for navigating large applications and debugging deeply nested components.

> 💡 It becomes especially useful when you're working on apps with reusable components and need to understand data flow between them.

## ✅ Takeaway

React Developer Tools makes it much easier to **visualize component hierarchies** and **track the flow of props and state** throughout an application. I plan to use it regularly as I continue building more complex React projects.
