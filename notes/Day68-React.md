# Day 68: Project Day 2

Yesterday, I have worked on implementing the Add functionality in the Note Taker app. Today I'll be working on the delete functionality. You can check the documentation in the Note Taker App directory for detailed info. The path is '/summer2025-learning-log/Projects/Note Taker App/Documentation.md'

Also I have setup the project locally so that I don't have to depend on code sandbox.
