# Day 66

I managed to get hands on knowledge about managing the state in react. I have been able to implement the delete functionality in a todo list where I have triggered deleting the item from child component and the function for deleting it is written inside the parent function. With the help of sending the function through props, I was able to accomplish it.

**NOTE**: Try to get clear understanding of how .filter() works. How it returns and all. Its useful.
