# Day 64: Back to React

I've been on vacation for 2 weeks and came back and kind of got lazy. Now that I am back, lets start off where we stopped, the project in react. We left it half way and honestly speaking, I am not so sure if I remember what I was doing. So, lets so through the notes and get to speed.

Revised most of the basic concepts until now. The only thing left is to understand how to manage a component tree. Once I am done with thet, I will be ready to start working on the note taking app project.
