# üìÖ Day 5 - React Notes Review

Today marks **Day 5** of my React learning journey. Instead of building something new, I took the time to **review and consolidate the notes** and concepts I‚Äôve covered over the past four days.

## üß† What I Did

- Revisited my notes from Day 1 to Day 4
- Reviewed core concepts including:
  - JSX syntax and how it translates to `React.createElement()`
  - Creating functional components
  - Using props to pass data between components
  - Organizing data using separate files (like `contacts.js`)
  - Importing and applying styles using `.css` in both `src/` and `public/` folders
  - Differences between sandboxed vs. local React development
- Reflected on the challenges I encountered and how I solved them

## ‚úçÔ∏è Why This Was Useful

- Reinforced my understanding of React fundamentals
- Helped identify patterns in how React projects are structured
- Gave me more confidence to move forward with new features and projects
- Allowed me to clean up and organize my notes for future reference

## ‚úÖ Summary

Day 5 was all about **reflection and reinforcement**. Reviewing the work I‚Äôve done so far helped me internalize important concepts and prepare myself to take on more advanced topics in React.
