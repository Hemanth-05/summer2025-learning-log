I’m dedicating time every day this summer to learning and improving skills that will help me grow in my professional career. 

I’m starting with **React** and **SQL**, and as I gain confidence in those, I plan to explore additional technologies and topics along the way.

This repository documents my daily learning journey — including notes, code snippets, and mini-projects — as I build consistency and grow as a developer.
