<!-- Project Idea -->
A website that tells the amount of groceries left in your fridge.
We have to add the items in our fridge and the quantity, and everytime you use it, just include it in the app. And the app keeps track of the items in the fridge. In the app there would be a display bar below every item where it says the percentage of item remaining in our fridge

<!-- Business Idea -->
Lets say when you are out of milk, the app recommends you to buy a milk and below there is a option to directly order it from lets say walmart. No we can ask walmart to pay us for including their link in our app. It should be so convinent for the user in such a way that, when they press "Buy now" on the milk, a pop up should come saying "Do you want to order the milk" and if he presses "yes" the order should be placed.

<!-- Strategy -->
The thing is, we cannot implement all of these right away. We first need people who want to use our app before we go on for a business out of it. First it should be just an app to track the quantity of items left in our fridge. Once that happens, once we get enough audience and people start to use it regularly, thats when we approach stores like Walmart, Foodlion etc and tell them "Hey we have these many people using our this app, we have this in mind and we want to include the link of ur store, how do you like it. If you like it we can talk thinks like how much you are willing to pay us for including your store link in our recommendations"
